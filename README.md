# Subway-App

Aaron Ashery

Spring 2022

Subway-App is a website designed to teach people how the New York subway ststem works. It was a class project for User Interface Design. The goal
was to work as a team to design a website that teaches something simple in about 10 minutes, and includes a quiz to test what was learnt. 
I worked with three other students on the project. My main contributions were in the quiz portion. I created interactive questions that involved HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
to navigate the page, and Python to do the scoring and database management.
